Minesweeper including AI (com-player)

_______________________________________________________
Plan:
2019-03-25: Want to create basic minesweeper program to play including having an AI to play for you.

Log:
2019-03-25: Finished up minesweeper without computer play. Will program the AI tomorrow.
2019-03-26: Did rule based computer play. Will clean up code tomorrow. EDIT: found a better way to do AI - will do that tomorrow.
2019-03-27: Cleaned up code-base. Gonna wait with implementation of optimized AI solution till later date.

Notes:
2019-03-26: Realized a more optimized AI solution based on probability.
2019-03-27: Realized a much smarter way of constructing core program. Instead of having an underlying table with a graphical cover, I can build the game as one cohesive class. Don't wanna rebuild the whole thing now as I believe starting from scratch is just as fast.
2019-03-27: Wanna wait with the optimized AI solution till I rebuild the game. For now I'll clean up this code and then return to this project later on.
